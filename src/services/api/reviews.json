         "text":"I found working with The webinar vet company to deliver the Virtual WVAC 2020 congress  an excellent experience. I was very impressed by the expertise, enthusiasm , knowledge and fast acting WV team who leapt in to action once the decision to move the congress to an online format was made. It was a pleasure working with the entire WV team and the NZVA CPD group forged great relationships particularly with Anthony Chadwick , Kathryn Bell  and Dawn Robinson. To turn the Virtual congress around in 3 short weeks was an exceptional effort on every ones part but it would not have been possible without the hard work from the WV team. The congress was a huge success which has been reflected by the excellent positive  feedback from delegates.  On behalf of the NZVA CPD team I would like to Thank WV for making the impossible possible and I am sure there will be opportunities for us all to work together again in the future",
