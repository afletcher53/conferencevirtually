        project_about_strapline: "<p>When I started The Webinar Vet in 2010, nobody had heard of webinars in the veterinary profession. I set it up because I wanted to make veterinary education more accessible and affordable to vets worldwide. With less stress too! At the end of a busy day in the practice, the very last thing I wanted to do was jump in the car and travel an hour to a hotel for some veterinary CPD. </p><br/><p>Amazingly, none of the traditional veterinary CPD companies had thought of this and for 12 months I was all alone in the online space. The company grew very quickly amongst vets and nurses because my pain was felt by them too. </p><p>The company has continued to grow quickly because I think the community senses that, as a vet, I want to help my fellow colleagues develop themselves and become better vets or nurses. </p><br/><p>There have been many highlights in the last nine years like winning the Regional Business Awards in my home city of Liverpool as the leading Knowledge Transfer Business of 2016. It was an emotional night and it was lovely to share it with the team. </p><br/><p>However, my two proudest moments have been our partnership with the Royal College in setting up mindfulness training for vets. This has been life-changing for some of the community and looking at the amazing team that I have helped to develop and grow over the last three years. They help me to develop as well! </p><br/><p>I'm truly blessed to have such a dedicated team who want to help all our community members.</p>"
